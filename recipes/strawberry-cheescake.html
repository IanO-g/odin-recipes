    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>Desssert and Desert are a letter away, yet in reality
        they couldn't be more different. I don't know how to segue that into
        cheesecake, yet here we are. Anyways, if you've clicked through the
        other recipes you'll see that we're missing a vital aspect to every meal. 
        Of course it's, salt intake and this cheesecake is low in that.

    <h3>Steps for Cheescake</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 325F degrees and position a rack in the middle to lower third of the oven.</li>
        <li>Lightly grease the bottom of a 9-inch round springform pan with non-stick cooking spray. </li>
        <li>In a medium bowl stir together the graham crumbs, sugar & butter. Press into the bottom of the springform pan, creating a slight ridge around the edges.</li>
        <li>Bake in the preheated oven for 10 minutes. Remove from the oven and cool.</li>
        <li>In a large bowl beat the cream cheese and sugar until smooth, turning off the mixer and scraping down the sides of the bowl as necessary. </li>
        <li>Mix in the vanilla extract and lemon juice. </li>
        <li>Sift in the cornstarch. Then beat in the sour cream.</li>
        <li>Mix in the eggs one at a time until just combined. Do not overmix.</li>
        <li>Pour the batter over the crust and bake for 1 hour or until the top looks set (not glossy) except for in the very center. If you give the pan a gentle nudge the cake should still have a slight wobble in the middle.</li>
        <li>Turn off the oven, open the oven door, and cool for 20 minutes in the oven. Then take the cheesecake out of the oven and bring to room temperature.</li>
        <li>Cover and chill in the fridge for 6 hours or overnight.</li>
    </ol>
    <h3>Steps for Strawberry Topping</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Add the strawberries, sugar, and lemon juice to a medium pan over low-medium heat. </li>
        <li>Gently stir to coat the strawberries.</li>
        <li>In a small bowl whisk the cornstarch and water to dissolve the cornstarch.</li>
        <li>Stir the cornstarch mixture into the strawberries and gently stir the mixture until it thickens and the strawberries start to soften.</li>
        <li>When ready to serve, remove the cheesecake from the fridge and unclamp the springform pan. </li>
        <li>Pour the strawberry topping over the cheesecake, and optionally decorate with whipped cream. </li>
    </ol>
